\chapter{Windows Management Instrumentation}
WMI is a subsystem of PowerShell that provides system administrators with
powerful tools for system monitoring. The goal of WMI is to consolidate device
and application management across corporate networks. WMI is a core part of the
Windows operating system and has come pre-installed since Windows 2000. It is
made up of the following components 

\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|l|X|}
   \hline 
Component Name &	Description\\
   \hline 
WMI service & 	The Windows Management Instrumentation process, which runs
automatically at boot and acts as an intermediary between WMI providers, the
WMI repository, and managing applications.\\
   \hline 
Managed objects &	Any logical or physical components that can be managed by
WMI.\\
   \hline 
WMI providers &	Objects that monitor events/data related to a specific
object.\\
   \hline 
Classes &	These are used by the WMI providers to pass data to the WMI
service.\\
   \hline 
Methods &	These are attached to classes and allow actions to be performed.
For example, methods can be used to start/stop processes on remote machines.\\
   \hline 
WMI repository &	A database that stores all static data related to WMI.\\
   \hline 
CMI Object Manager &	The system that requests data from WMI providers and
returns it to the application requesting it.\\
   \hline 
WMI API &	Enables applications to access the WMI infrastructure.\\
   \hline 
WMI Consumer &	Sends queries to objects via the CMI Object Manager.\\
   \hline 
\end{tabularx}

Some of the uses for WMI are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Status information for local/remote systems
    \item  Configuring security settings on remote machines/applications
    \item  Setting and changing user and group permissions
    \item  Setting/modifying system properties
    \item  Code execution
    \item  Scheduling processes
    \item  Setting up logging
\end{itemize}

These tasks can all be performed using a combination of PowerShell and the WMI
Command-Line Interface (WMIC):

module} for PowerShell.

        module}

\subsection{Quick notes}

get-help transaction
get-help transcription

\$PROFILE  
1- create you profile
2- apply profile
3 run PS in Unrestricted or Bypass

\begin{verbatim}
$Transcriptionlo = $env:computername+'--'+(Get-Date -UFormat '%Y%m%d')
    Start-Transcript -LiteralPath 'c:\transcript\$Transcript.log' - Append
\end{verbatim}

get-help wmi
get-help CMI

CMI kind of new version of WMI. Faster and more elegant

Get-WMIObject -Class XXX | get-member
Get-WMIObject -Class XXX -Filter XXX
Get-WMIObject -Query 'Select * from \ldots where\ldots
Get-WMIObject -List *

WMI (windows management instrumentation) => objects

Get-WMIObjet, Set-WMIObject, Remove-WMIObject

CMI (common information model) => classes
Get-CIMClass -ClassName
Get-CIMClass -ClassName XXX | Get-Member
