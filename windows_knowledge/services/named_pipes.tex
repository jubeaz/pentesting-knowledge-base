\section{Named pipes}

Pipes are used for communication between two applications or processes using
shared memory. There are two types of pipes,
\href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes}{named
pipes} (for example \verb+\\.\PipeName\\ExampleNamedPipeServer+) and anonymous
pipes.

Windows systems use a i\emph{client-server implementation} for pipe
communication:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the server create the pipe
    \item the client communicate with the pipe
\end{itemize}

Named pipes can communicate using \emph{half-duplex}, or a \emph{one-way
channel} with the client only being able to write data to the server, or
\emph{duplex}, which is a two-way communication channel that allows the client
to write data over the pipe, and the server to respond back with data over that
pipe. Every active connection to a named pipe server results in the creation of
a new named pipe. These all share the same pipe name but communicate using a
different data buffer.
