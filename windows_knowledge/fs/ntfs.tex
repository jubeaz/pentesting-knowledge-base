An Alternate Data Stream is a little-known feature of the NTFS file system. It
has the ability of forking data into an existing file without changing its file
size or functionality.

Think of ADS as a ‘file inside another file’.

ADS exists in all versions of Microsoft’s NTFS file system, and it has been
available since Windows NT was released.

It was originally intended to allow for compatibility with Macintosh’s
Hierarchical File System (HFS).

Currently, all Windows Operating Systems, including the latest Windows 10 OS,
supports the ADS feature.

C:> echo The sun is all up and the coast is clear > file1.txt:hidden
C:> type file1.txt:hidden # will produce an error
C:> more < file1.txt:hidden
