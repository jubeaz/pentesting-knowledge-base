Among many others, the following object types are securable:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Files and directories on NTFS volumes
        \item Registry keys (but not values)
        \item Network shares
        \item Printers
        \item Services
        \item Active Directory objects
        \item Processes
\end{itemize}

Of these types, some are hierarchical in nature (directories, registry keys, …), and some are not (printers, services, …).
