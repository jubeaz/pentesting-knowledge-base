The \emph{Security Reference Monitor
(SRM)}\label{win:SRM}\index{Windows!Security Reference Monitor (SRM)} is in charge to compare the security descriptors in the token with the security IDs for every file, folder, printer, or application that the user attempts to access. In this way, the access token provides a security context for the security principalâ€™s actions on the computer.

For information about how access tokens are used in conjunction with logon and authentication in Windows, see the
