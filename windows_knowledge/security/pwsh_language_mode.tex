\section{PowerShell ConstrainedLanguage Mode}
In PowerShell, there are four different language modes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        FullLanguage: The default language mode, no restrictions.
    \item 
        RestrictedLanguage: Users may run commands, but may not use script blocks.
    \item 
        ConstrainedLanguage: Operations which could be abused by a malicious actor are restricted.
    \item 
        NoLanguage: Completely disables the PowerShell scripting language
\end{itemize}

By default, PowerShell sessions use the FullLanguage mode. 

When AppLocker is configured on a system, the PowerShell mode is automatically set to ConstrainedLanguage for all users, the exception is PowerShell sessions launched with a High Integrity Level, which are set to FullLanguage.

When running in ConstrainedLanguage mode, a lot of restrictions are put into place. Notably:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        Add-Type may not load arbitrary \verb+C#+ or Win32 APIs
    \item 
        Only types from a relatively short whitelist may be used
\end{itemize}
