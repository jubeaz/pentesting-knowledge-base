\subsection{Restricted Admin}

Restricted Admin Mode was introduced in Windows 8.1 as an attempt to prevent credential exposure via RDP. While well intentioned, this unfortunately introduced the ability to pass-the-hash to RDP.

When this mode is enabled the RDP client will not send plain-text or any other re-usable form of credentials to the remote PC or Server. 

when trying to perform a rdp pth if the mode is disabled then the following error should be visible:
\begin{verbatim}
Account restrictions are preventing this user from signing in. For example: blan passwords aren't...
\end{verbatim}

Restricted Admin mode allows logging in to an RDP host without transmitting login credentials over the network. To do this, it redirects the Kerberos requests back to the client that wants to establish the connection.

Restricted Admin mode requires that the user be a member o the Local Administrators group on the RDP server.
