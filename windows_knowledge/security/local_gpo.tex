\section{Local Group Policy}
Group Policy allows administrators to set, configure, and adjust a variety of settings. In a domain environment, group policies are pushed down from a Domain Controller onto all domain-joined machines that Group Policy objects (GPOs) are linked to. These settings can also be defined on individual machines using Local Group Policy.

Group Policy can be configured locally, in both domain environments and non-domain environments. Local Group Policy can be used to tweak certain graphical and network settings that are otherwise not accessible via the Control Panel. It can also be used to lock down an individual computer policy with stringent security settings, such as only allowing certain programs to be installed/run or enforcing strict user account password requirements.

We can open the Local Group Policy Editor by opening the Start menu and typing
\verb+gpedit.msc+. The editor is split into two categories under Local Computer
Policy - \emph{Computer Configuration} and \emph{User Configuration}.

 
Local Group Policy Editor enables fine-tuned account auditing and configure
AppLocker.
