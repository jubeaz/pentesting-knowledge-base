\section{Interactive}

An interactive, or local logon session, is initiated by a user authenticating to a local or domain system by entering their credentials. An interactive logon can be initiated by logging directly into the system, by requesting a secondary logon session using the runas command via the command line, or through a Remote Desktop connection.
