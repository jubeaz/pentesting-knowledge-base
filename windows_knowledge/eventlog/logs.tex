\section{Logs}

The logs are categorized into different event logs, such as "Application", "System", "Security", and others, to organize events based on their source or purpose.

\subsection{Classic /Modern Event Logs }
All logs post-Windows Vista save as \verb+*.evtx+ files instead of an older \verb+*.evt+ format.

The property \verb+IsClassicLog+ states whether the log events are defined in a Message File, \verb+*.mc+, format or in a manifest, \verb+*.xml+, format.

\subsection{Where Windows Stores Security Events}
\begin{verbatim}
$arrLogs = @(
     "Application"
     "Security"
     "System"
 )

$arrLogs | ForEach-Object {
     Get-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\$_ -Name File |
     Select-Object PSChildName,File
 }
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{log mode}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
        Circular – Overwrite the oldest log entry once full.
    \item
        Retain – Keep all events until the log is full and stop logging until freed.
    \item
        AutoBackup – Automatically back up and archive event logs once full.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{log type}
\begin{itemize}
    \item     
        Administrative – Primarily intended for end-users and administrative users.
    \item 
        Analytical – Typically, a high volume log, meant to describe program operations.
    \item 
        Debug – Meant for developers needing a deep-dive into program internals.
    \item 
        Operational – An event that occurs during operation and is useful to diagnose occurrences and trigger processes.
\end{itemize}
