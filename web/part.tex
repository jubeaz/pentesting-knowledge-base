\part{Web Application Pentesting}
\label{part:web}

The
attack categories that we'll discuss as we proceed are grouped as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Authentication, authorization, and session management attacks: These attacks
             (and our tests) focus on the rigor with which the application itself verifies the
             identity and enforces the privilege of a particular user. These tests will focus on
             convincing the Web Tier that we belong in the conversation.

\item Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks: XSS attacks involve manipulating either the
             client or the web and/or application tiers into diverting a valid session's traffic or
             attention to a hostile location, which can allow the attacker to exploit valid clients
             through scripts. Hijacking attempts often fit in this category as well.

\item Injections and overflows: Various attacks find places throughout the 3-tier
             design to force applications to work outside tested boundaries by injecting code
             that maybe allowed by the underlying modules but should be prohibited by the
             application's implementation. Most of these injections (SQL, HTML, XML, and so
             on) can force the application to divulge information that should not be allowed,
             or they can help the attacker find administrative privileges to initiate a
straightforward dump by themselves.

\item Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks: Session hijacking is a means by which the
hacker or tester intercepts a session without the knowledge of either side. After
doing so, the hacker has the ability to manipulate or fuzz requests and responses
to manipulate one or both sides and uncover more data than what the legitimate
user was actually after or entitled to have.

\item Application tier attacks: Some applications are not configured to validate inputs
/bin/bash: line 1: q: command not found
granted. It is also common to see applications fall short in enforcing true role-
based controls; and privilege escalation attacks often occur, giving hackers the
run of the house.
