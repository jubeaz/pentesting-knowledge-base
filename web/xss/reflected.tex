\subsection{Reflected XSS}
The simplest variety of XSS. It arises when an application receives data in an
HTTP request and includes that data within the immediate response in an unsafe
way. 

 If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perform any action within the application that the user can perform.
    \item View any information that the user is able to view.
    \item Modify any information that the user is able to modify.
    \item Initiate interactions with other application users, including
        malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial
        victim user.
\end{itemize}
