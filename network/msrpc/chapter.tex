\section{Itroduction}
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_RPC}{MSRPC (Microsoft Remote
Procedure Call)} is a protocol commonly related to SMB.  RPC provides an
application developer a generic way to execute a procedure in a local or remote
process without having to understand the network protocols used to support the
communication, as specified in
\href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rpce/290c38b1-92fe-4229-91e6-4fc376610c15}{MS-RPCE},
which defines an RPC over SMB Protocol that can use SMB Protocol named pipes as
its underlying transport.
