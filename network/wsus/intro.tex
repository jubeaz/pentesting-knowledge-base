WSUS enables system administrators in organizations to centrally manage the
distribution of updates and hotfixes released by Microsoft to a fleet of
systems.

Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) acts as a proxy to Microsoftâ€™s public Windows
Update service. The WSUS server fetches updates via the Internet from Windows Update
and caches them locally. Intranet-based PCs are then configured to fetch updates from
the WSUS server. This gives administrators greater control over how updates are
deployed on their network.

The address of the WSUS server is configured using the following registry key:
\begin{verbatim}
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\W
UServer
\end{verbatim}

For example, the value of WUServer may be \verb+http://wsus-server:8530+. Port
8530 is the default port used for WSUS. These settings will typically be
configured via Group Policy.
