\section{Replay attack}
A  replay attack occurs if an attacker steals the packet sent from the  user to the service, which they can then use to gain access to the  service without knowing the user's credentials. 
This is generally  low risk and is mitigated by the system checking the timestamp of the  packet - any timestamp earlier or the same as a previous packet is  rejected, as well as any timestamp out of sync with the server time by  over 5 minutes.
