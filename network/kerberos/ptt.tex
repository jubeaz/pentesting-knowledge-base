\subsection{Pass the ticket}
\label{network:kerberos:ptt}
In  this attack, the threat actor creates a fake session key by forging a  fake TGT. The attacker will present this to the service as a valid  credential. 
In order to execute this attack, the attacker must  obtain access to the session key. To perform this attack, an attacker  would obtain Kerberos tickets from the memory of the LSASS process, and  then inject the stolen TGT into their own session, which will let them  adopt the identity and privileges of the stolen TGT.
