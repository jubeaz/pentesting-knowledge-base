In computing, Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a graphical desktop-sharing
system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control
another computer. It transmits the keyboard and mouse events from one computer
to another, relaying the graphical-screen updates back in the other direction,
over a network.
