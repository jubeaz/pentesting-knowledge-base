\section{Introduction}
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol for sending emails in an
IP network. It can be used between an email client and an outgoing mail server
or between two SMTP servers. SMTP is often combined with the IMAP or POP3
protocols, which can fetch emails and send emails. In principle, it is a
client-server-based protocol, although SMTP can be used between a client and a
server and between two SMTP servers. In this case, a server effectively acts as
a client.

The original SMTP protocol supported only unauthenticated unencrypted 7-bit
ASCII text communications, susceptible to trivial man-in-the-middle attack,
spoofing, and spamming, and requiring any binary data to be encoded to readable
text before transmission. Due to absence of a proper authentication mechanism,
by design every SMTP server was an open mail relay.

An {\bf open mail relay} is a SMTP server configured in such a way that it
allows anyone on the Internet to send e-mail through it, not just mail destined
to or originating from known users.

In November 1995, RFC 1869 defined {\bf Extended Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
    (ESMTP)}, which established a general structure for all existing and future
    extensions which aimed to add-in the features missing from the original
    SMTP. ESMTP defines consistent and manageable means by which ESMTP clients
    and servers can be identified and servers can indicate supported
    extensions. 

Message submission (RFC 2476) and
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP_Authenticatio}{SMTP-AUTH
(RFC 2554)} were introduced in 1998
and 1999, both describing new trends in email delivery. Originally, SMTP
servers were typically internal to an organization, receiving mail for the
organization from the outside, and relaying messages from the organization to
the outside. But as time went on, SMTP servers ({\bf mail transfer agents MTA}), in
practice, were expanding their roles to become {\bf message submission agents
(MSA)}for {\bf Mail user agents (MUA)}, some of which were now relaying mail
from the outside of an organization. (e.g. a company executive wishes to send
email while on a trip using the corporate SMTP server.) 

A  {\bf MSA} is a computer program or software agent that receives electronic
mail messages from a mail user agent (MUA) and cooperates with a mail transfer
agent (MTA) for delivery of the mail. It uses ESMTP. both MTA and MSA functions
use port number 25, but the official port for MSAs is 587.The MTA accepts a
user's incoming mail, while the MSA accepts a user's outgoing mail. 

This issue, a consequence of the rapid expansion and popularity of the World
Wide Web, meant that SMTP had to include specific rules and methods for
relaying mail and authenticating users to prevent abuses such as relaying of
unsolicited email (spam). Work on message submission (RFC 2476) was originally
started because popular mail servers would often rewrite mail in an attempt to
fix problems in it, for example, adding a domain name to an unqualified
address. This behavior is helpful when the message being fixed is an initial
submission, but dangerous and harmful when the message originated elsewhere and
is being relayed. Cleanly separating mail into submission and relay was seen as
a way to permit and encourage rewriting submissions while prohibiting rewriting
relay. As spam became more prevalent, it was also seen as a way to provide
authorization for mail being sent out from an organization, as well as
traceability. This separation of relay and submission quickly became a
foundation for modern email security practices. 

As this protocol started out purely ASCII text-based, it did not deal well with
binary files, or characters in many non-English languages. Standards such as
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) were developed to encode binary
files for transfer through SMTP. 

\subsection{Mail processing model}

\end{figure}

Email is submitted by a MUA to a mail server MSA using SMTP on TCP port 587.
Most mailbox providers still allow submission on traditional port 25. The MSA
delivers the mail to its MTA. Often, these two agents are instances of the same
software launched with different options on the same machine. If processing is
on multiple machines, they transfer messages between each other using SMTP,
where each machine is configured to use the next machine as a smart host. Each
process is an MTA (an SMTP server) in its own right. 

The boundary MTA uses DNS to look up the MX (mail exchanger) record for the
recipient's domain. The MX record contains the name of the target MTA. Based on
the target host and other factors, the sending MTA selects a recipient server
and connects to it to complete the mail exchange.

Message transfer can occur in a single connection between two MTAs, or in a
series of hops through intermediary systems. A receiving SMTP server may be the
ultimate destination, an intermediate "relay" (that is, it stores and forwards
the message) or a "gateway" (that is, it may forward the message using some
protocol other than SMTP).

Once the final hop accepts the incoming message, it hands it to a {\bf mail
delivery agent (MDA)} for local delivery. An MDA saves messages in the relevant
mailbox format. As with sending, this reception can be done using one or
multiple computers, but in the diagram above the MDA is depicted as one box
near the mail exchanger box. An MDA may deliver messages directly to storage,
or forward them over a network using SMTP or other protocol such as
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Mail_Transfer_Protocol}{Local Mail
Transfer Protocol (LMTP)}, a derivative of SMTP designed for this purpose.

SMTP defines message transport, not the message content. Thus, it defines the
mail envelope and its parameters, such as the envelope sender, but not the
header (except trace information) nor the body of the message itself. STD 10
and \href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5321}{RFC 5321} define SMTP
(the envelope), while STD 11 and
\href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322}{RFC5322} define the
message (header and body), formally referred to as the Internet Message
Format.

\subsection{SMTP commands and example}

The sending and communication are also done by special commands that cause the
SMTP server to do what the user requires.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Basic SMTP commands:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \verb+HELO domain+: logs in with its computer name and thus starts
    the session.
            \item \verb+MAIL FROM+: names the email sender.
            \item \verb+RCPT TO+: names the email recipient.
            \item \verb+DATA+: initiates the transmission of the email.
            \item \verb+RSET+: aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server.
            \item \verb+NOOP+: requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out.
            \item \verb+QUIT+: terminates the session.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Extended SMTP (ESMTP) Commands:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \verb+EHLO+: initiates the SMTP communication
            \item \verb+AUTH method+: used to authenticate the client to the
                server (\verb+PLAIN+, \verb+NTLM+, \verb+CRAM-MD5+,
                \verb+DIGEST-MD5+,\ldots)
            \item \verb+VRFY+: checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer.
            \item \verb+EXPN+: checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command.
            \item \verb+STARTTLS+: 
            \item \verb+HELP+ 	Help.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SMTP Extensions}
\subsection{Extension discovery mechanism}

Clients learn a server's supported options by using the \verb+EHLO+ greeting, as
exemplified below, instead of the original \verb+HELO+. Clients fall back to
\verb+HELO+ only if the server does not support EHLO greeting.

Modern clients may use the ESMTP extension keyword SIZE to query the server for
the maximum message size that will be accepted. Older clients and servers may
try to transfer excessively sized messages that will be rejected after
consuming network resources, including connect time to network links that is
paid by the minute.

Users can manually determine in advance the maximum size accepted by ESMTP
servers. The client replaces the HELO command with the EHLO command.

\begin{verbatim}
$ telnet 10.10.11.175 25
Trying 10.10.11.175...
Connected to 10.10.11.175.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 mail.outdated.htb ESMTP
EHLO outdated.htb
250-mail.outdated.htb
250-SIZE 20480000
250-AUTH LOGIN
250 HELP
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{STARTTLS or "Opportunistic TLS}
The STARTTLS extensions enables supporting SMTP servers to notify connecting
clients that it supports TLS encrypted communication and offers the opportunity
for clients to upgrade their connection by sending the STARTTLS command.
Servers supporting the extension do not inherently gain any security benefits
from its implementation on its own, as upgrading to a TLS encrypted session is
dependent on the connecting client deciding to exercise this option, hence the
term opportunistic TLS.

By sending {\bf STARTTLS}  after the {\bf EHLO command} the communication is
switched on port  465.

\begin{verbatim}
openssl s_client -crlf -connect smtp.mailgun.org:465 #SSL/TLS without starttls 
openssl s_client -starttls smtp -crlf -connect smtp.mailgun.org:587
\end{verbatim}
