\section{Dangerous Settings}
To prevent the sent emails from being filtered by spam filters and not reaching
the recipient, the sender can use a relay server that the recipient trusts. It
is an SMTP server that is known and verified by all others. As a rule, the
sender must authenticate himself to the relay server before using it.

Often, administrators have no overview of which IP ranges they have to allow.
This results in a misconfiguration of the SMTP server that we will still often
find in external and internal penetration tests. Therefore, they allow all IP
addresses not to cause errors in the email traffic and thus not to disturb or
unintentionally interrupt the communication with potential and current
customers.
