Nevertheless, configuration options that were improperly configured could allow
us to obtain more information, such as debugging the executed commands on the
service or logging in as anonymous, similar to the FTP service. Most companies
use third-party email providers such as Google, Microsoft, and many others.
However, some companies still use their own mail servers for many different
reasons. One of these reasons is to maintain the privacy that they want to keep
in their own hands. Many configuration mistakes can be made by administrators,
which in the worst cases will allow us to read all the emails sent and
received, which may even contain confidential or sensitive information. Some of
these configuration options include:

\begin{itemize}
        \item \verb+auth_debug+ 	Enables all authentication debug logging.
        \item \verb+auth_debug_passwords+ 	This setting adjusts log verbosity, the submitted passwords, and the scheme gets logged.
        \item \verb+auth_verbose+ 	Logs unsuccessful authentication attempts and their reasons.
        \item \verb+auth_verbose_passwords+ 	Passwords used for authentication are logged and can also be truncated.
        \item \verb+auth_anonymous_username+ 	This specifies the username to be used when logging in with the ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism.
\end{itemize}
