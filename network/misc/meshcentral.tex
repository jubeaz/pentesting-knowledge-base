\section{MeshCentral}

\href{https://github.com/Ylianst/MeshCentral}{MeshCentral} provides a centralized platform for managing multiple devices over the internet or a local network. It allows IT administrators to perform various tasks such as remote desktop control, file transfer, terminal access, and monitoring of devices.

The agent-based installation method used by MeshCentral involves creating a service on the remote computer that connects to the MeshCentral server via port 443 by default. As a result, even if a device has most ports blocked, it may still maintain an open connection for remote management or software deployment tools.

Note: In a hardened environment, administrators often restrict management ports to specific servers or workstations. As an attacker, we can identify if particular software is installed on a system by examining the list of installed software or scanning for open ports locally.
