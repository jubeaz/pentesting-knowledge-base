nmap scripts:
\begin{itemize}
\item nbd-info: Displays protocol and block device information from NBD servers.

\item nbstat: Attempts to retrieve the target's NetBIOS names and MAC address.

\item broadcast-netbios-master-browser: Attempts to discover master browsers and the domains they manage.

\item nbns-interfaces: Retrieves IP addresses of the target's network interfaces via NetBIOS NS. Additional network interfaces may reveal more information about the target, including finding paths to hidden non-routed networks via multihomed systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{nbstat}

The nbtstat program is designed to display NetBIOS protocol statistics and current TCP/IP connections using NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP). The nbtstat program is preinstalled on Windows, that is, it does not need to be downloaded and installed, but it must be run on the command line. See “How to set up the PowerShell environment on Windows and Linux”.
