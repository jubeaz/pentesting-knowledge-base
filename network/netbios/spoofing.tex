\subsection{Invoke-inveigh}

Inveigh~\ref{tool:inveigh} is a PowerShell ADIDNS/LLMNR/NBNS/mDNS/DNS spoofer and a man-in-the-middle attack tool designed to help penetration testers/red timers that are limited to Windows.

Inveigh tutorials are being prepared for this program for Miloserdov.org website.

An example of starting an inspectation without attack:
\begin{verbatim}
Import-Module ./Inveigh.psd1
Invoke-Inveigh -Inspect -ConsoleOutput Y
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Responder}

Responder~\ref{tool:responder} is a tool for performing a man-in-the-middle attack against authentication methods in Windows. This program includes the LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner, thanks to which traffic is redirected with requests and authentication hashes. The program also includes HTTP/SMB/MSSQL/FTP/LDAP authentication rogue servers that support authentication methods such as NTLMv1/NTLMv2/LMv2, Extended Security NTLMSSP and basic HTTP authentication, for which the Responder acts as a relay.

\subsection{Metasploit}
Metasploit has several built-in scanners and spoofing modules made to deal with poisoning attacks.
