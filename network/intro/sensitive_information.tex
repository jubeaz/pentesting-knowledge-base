\section{Sensitive information}

When attacking a service, we usually play a detective role, and we need to
collect as much information as possible and carefully observe the details.
Therefore, every single piece of information is essential.

Let us imagine we are in an engagement with a client, we are targeting email,
FTP, databases, and storage, and our goal is to obtain Remote Code Execution
(RCE) on any of these services. We started the enumeration and tried anonymous
access to all services, and only FTP has anonymous access. We found an empty
file within the FTP service, but with the name johnsmith, we tried johnsmith as
the FTP user and password, but it did not work. We try the same against the
email service, and we successfully login. With email access, we start searching
emails containing the word password, we find many, but one of them contains
John's credentials for the MSSQL database. We access the database and use the
built-in functionality to execute commands and successfully get RCE on the
database server. We successfully met our goal.

A misconfigured service let us access a piece of information that initially may
look insignificant, johnsmith, but that information opened the doors for us to
discover more information and finally get remote code execution on the database
server. This is the importance of paying attention to every piece of
information, every detail, as we enumerate and attack common services.a

Sensitive information may include, but is not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Usernames.
    \item  Email Addresses.
    \item  Passwords.
    \item  DNS records.
    \item  IP Addresses.
    \item  Source code.
    \item  Configuration files.
    \item  PII (Personal Identifiable Information).
\end{itemize}


Every target is unique, and we need to familiarize ourselves with our target,
its processes, procedures, business model, and purpose. Once we understand our
target, we can think about what information is essential for them and what kind
of information is helpful for our attack.

There are two key elements to finding sensitive information:
\begin{itemize}
        \item understand the service and how it works.
        \item know what to look for.
\end{itemize}
