In addition, we can use --packet-trace to track the individual packages and
inspect their contents manually. We can see that the RDP cookies
(mstshash=nmap) used by Nmap to interact with the RDP server can be identified
by threat hunters and various security services such as Endpoint Detection and
Response (EDR), and can lock us out as penetration testers on hardened
networks.a

A Perl script named \href{https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/rdp-sec-check/blob/master/rdp-sec-check.pl}{rdp-sec-check.pl} has also been developed by Cisco CX
Security Labs that can unauthentically identify the security settings of RDP
servers based on the handshakes.
