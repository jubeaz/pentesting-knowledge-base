\chapter{FTP/TFTP}

\section{Introduction}

l. In an FTP connection, two channels are opened. First, the client and server
establish a {\bf control channel (TCP/21)}. The client sends commands to
the server, and the server returns status codes. Then both communication
participants can establish the {\bf data channel(TCP/20)}. This channel is
used exclusively for data transmission, and the protocol watches for errors
during this process. If a connection is broken off during transmission, the
transport can be resumed after re-established contact.

A distinction is made between {\bf active} and {\bf passive} FTP. In the active variant,
the client establishes the connection as described via TCP port 21 and thus
informs the server via which client-side port the server can transmit its
responses. However, if a firewall protects the client, the server cannot reply
because all external connections are blocked. For this purpose, the passive
mode has been developed. Here, the server announces a port through which the
client can establish the data channel. Since the client initiates the
connection in this method, the firewall does not block the transfer.

{\bf Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)} is simpler than FTP and performs
file transfers between client and server processes. However, it {\bf does not}
provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP. In
addition, while FTP uses TCP, TFTP uses [\bf UDP}, making it an unreliable protocol
and causing it to use UDP-assisted application layer recovery.
