\subsection{Responder}
Responder~\ref{tool:responder} is a tool for performing a man-in-the-middle attack against authentication methods in Windows. This program includes the LLMNR, NBT-NS and MDNS poisoner, thanks to which traffic is redirected with requests and authentication hashes. The program also includes HTTP/SMB/MSSQL/FTP/LDAP authentication rogue servers that support authentication methods such as NTLMv1/NTLMv2/LMv2, Extended Security NTLMSSP and basic HTTP authentication, for which the Responder acts as a relay.
