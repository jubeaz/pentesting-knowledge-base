MySQL supports
\href{https://rsc.anu.edu.au/~rsccu/manuals/mySQL/refman-5.0-en.html-chapter/extending-mysql.html#adding-udf}{User
Defined Functions} which allows us to execute C/C++ code as a function within
SQL, there's one User Defined Function for command execution in this
\href{https://github.com/mysqludf/lib_mysqludf_sys}{GitHub repository}. It is
not common to encounter a user-defined function like this in a production
environment, but we should be aware that we may be able to use it.

\begin{verbatim}
#Get a shell with the mysql client user
\! sh
\end{verbatim}
