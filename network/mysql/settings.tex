\section{Dangerous Settings}
The settings {\bf user}, {\bf password}, and {\bf admin\_address} are
security-relevant because the entries are made in plain text. Often, the rights
for the configuration file of the MySQL server are not assigned correctly. If
we get another way to read files or even a shell, we can see the file and the
username and password for the MySQL server. Suppose there are no other security
measures to prevent unauthorized access. In that case, the entire database and
all the existing customers' information, email addresses, passwords, and
personal data can be viewed and even edited.


The {\bf debug} and {\bf sql\_warnings} settings provide verbose information
output in case of errors, which are essential for the administrator but should
not be seen by others. This information often contains sensitive content, which
could be detected by trial and error to identify further attack possibilities.
These error messages are often displayed directly on web applications.
Accordingly, the SQL injections could be manipulated even to have the MySQL
server execute system commands.
