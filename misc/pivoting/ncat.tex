ncat can be setup as an http proxy which can be used similar to a socks proxy. Just run the ncat proxy on the target machine, and update the local proxychains config to use an http proxy.

Unfortunately, ncat is almost never going to be installed by default on a target machine, unless someone has also installed nmap there.

\subsubsection{Target machine - setup ncat listener}
\begin{verbatim}
ncat -vv --listen 3128 --proxy-type http # or socks5
\end{verbatim}




\subsubsection{attacker machine}
\begin{verbatim}
tail /etc/proxychains.conf -n 3
# defaults set to "tor"
#socks4 	127.0.0.1 9050
http 172.21.0.3  3128 # 172.21.0.3 is the IP of my ssh machine

proxychains nmap -sT -P0 -p8080,9001 172.20.0.2
\end{verbatim}
