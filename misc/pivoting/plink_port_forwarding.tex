\section{plink (Windows)}

\href{https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html}{Plink},
short for PuTTY Link, is a Windows command-line SSH tool that comes as a part
of the PuTTY package when installed. Similar to SSH, Plink can also be used to
create dynamic port forwards and SOCKS proxies.

\begin{verbatim}
plink -D $LPORT $user@$PIP
\end{verbatim}

Another Windows-based tool called \href{https://www.proxifier.com/}{Proxifier}
can be used to start a SOCKS tunnel via the SSH session created.
