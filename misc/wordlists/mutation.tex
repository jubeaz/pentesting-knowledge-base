hashcat --force password.list -r custom.rule --stdout | sort -u > mut_password.list
\end{verbatim}

    \item JtR~\ref{tool:jtr}
\begin{verbatim}
./john -wordlist=wordlist.list -rules:KoreLogicRulesAppendYears -stdout > mwordlist.list

which is featured in the book

Hack Like a Legend}. These are curated rulesets generally targeted at common corporate Windows password policies or based on statistics and probably industry password patterns.
