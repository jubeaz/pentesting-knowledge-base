\section{ASREPRoasting}
\label{kerberos:asrepraosting}
\emph{AS-REProasting} is an offensive  technique against Kerberos that allows
password hashes to be retrieved  for users that do not
\href{https://www.tenable.com/blog/how-to-stop-the-kerberos-pre-authentication-attack-in-active-directory}{require
pre-authentication}. In such a case an attacker can  recover a Kerberos
\verb+AS-REP+ encrypted with the users RC4-HMACâ€™d password  and he can attempt to crack this ticket offline.

Pre-authentication is the initial stage  in Kerberos authentication, which is
managed by the KDC Authentication  server and is meant to prevent brute-force
attacks.
