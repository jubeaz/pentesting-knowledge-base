A silver ticket is similar to a Golden Ticket, but does not have the broad administrative privileges of the golden ticket. 
An  attacker would typically only gain access to a single service on an  application, and an attacker must have compromised legitimate user  credentials from a computer's SAM or local service account. 
What  makes these attacks very difficult to detect is that forging a silver  ticket (for example using the service account password hash) does not  require any communication with a DC.
