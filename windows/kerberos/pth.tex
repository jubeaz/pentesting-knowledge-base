\section{Pass the hash attack}
\label{kerberos:pth}
This  is a technique where an attacker obtains a user's NTLM password hash,  and subsequently passes the hash through for NTLM authentication  purposes. 
This works because systems do not actually validate a  user's password, but rather the hash of the password. This attack only  works against interactive logons using NTLM authentication.
