In  a backdoor skeleton key malware attack, the attacker typically has  compromised the Domain Controller and executed a successful Golden  Ticket attack. 
The malware injects into LSASS a master password  that would work against any account in the domain. When the account  authenticates, the malware will check the injected master password hash,  and if it's a match will authenticate the user, regardless of the  user's true password. Legitimate users will still be able to log in with  their normal credentials.
