\section{Overpass the hash}
A  combination of Pass the hash and Pass the ticket, an attacker uses a  compromised hash to obtain a Kerberos ticket that they can use to access  a resource. 
Often useful if you need Kerberos authentication if NTLM is disabled to reach your target but only have a compromised hash.
