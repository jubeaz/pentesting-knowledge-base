\subsection{Silver Ticket Attack}
\url{https://en.hackndo.com/kerberos-silver-golden-tickets/}


A silver ticket is similar to a Golden Ticket, but does not have the broad administrative privileges of the golden ticket. 
An  attacker would typically only gain access to a single service on an  application, and an attacker must have compromised legitimate user  credentials from a computer's SAM or local service account. 
What  makes these attacks very difficult to detect is that forging a silver  ticket (for example using the service account password hash) does not  require any communication with a DC.

Whatever the circumstances, once an attacker has a foothold on a  single network system, they can start laying the groundwork for forging a  Kerberos Silver Ticket. This involves:
1. Conduct reconnaissance to gather information about the domain, such as the domain name and domain security identifier (SID), both of which are relatively easily obtained by a whoami command on Windows.
2. Obtain the DNS name under which the service principal name (SPN) for the targeted, local service they wish to attack is registered as well as the service type.
3. Use Mimikatz or a similar tool to obtain the local NTLM password (or password hash) for the Kerberos service running on the compromised system, for example: Windows file share, SQL, email, Microsoft Sharepoint and so on. Service password hashes can be obtained from a number of sources on a compromised local system. For example, they can be dumped from the local computer’s Security Account Manager (SAM) or local service account.
4. Obtain the unencrypted password for the service. These can be obtained from the hash using methods like offline cracking (“Kerberoasting”) to obtain the unencrypted password data.
5. Use Mimikatz or a similar tool to forge a Kerberos Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket allowing the attacker to authenticate to the targeted service.
6. Authenticate to the local service directly using the credentials and forged TGS.
7. Manipulate the TGS to elevate the attacker’s permissions to that of Domain Administrator.


In order to generate a Silver-Ticket you require the NTLM hash of a Service
Account, typically services run under traditional user accounts with a SPN
value for ex. mssql \& iis user etc.

Silver Tickets not only apply too User Accounts they also apply to Computer Accounts as sometimes System Services run under the Computer Account in this case the NTLM hash of the Computer would be used to generate the ticket.
For example: If I was an attacker and I gained access to a computer  running a service and I elevated to admin/system I could dump the NTLM hash of respective account (Computer or User) and generate a silver ticket impersonating said user.
With said generated ticket we could employ a Pass-The-Ticket attack and/or Inject the ticket into our current session to access other available resources.
Before I proceed with the Windows / Linux practical sections I would  just like to provide a brief overview of practical examples and when to  use Silver Tickets.
