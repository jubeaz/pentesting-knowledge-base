\subsection{Pass the hash attack}
\label{kerberos:pth}
This  is a technique where an attacker obtains a user's NTLM password hash,  and subsequently passes the hash through for NTLM authentication  purposes. 
This works because systems do not actually validate a  user's password, but rather the hash of the password. This attack only  works against interactive logons using NTLM authentication.

This technic is worth trying for example with Local Administrator account since
dut to automatic mastering of endpoint the local Administrator hash might be
used on lot of endpoints.

tools allowing path the hash:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CrackMapExec
    \item impacket tools (psexec, smbclient, wmiexec, rpcdump, \ldots)
    \item metaploit
    \item empire
    \item pth toolkit
\end{itemize}
