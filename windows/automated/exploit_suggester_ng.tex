\section{Windows Exploit Suggester - Next Generation}
\href{https://github.com/bitsadmin/wesng}{WES-NG} is a tool based on the output
of Windows' systeminfo utility which provides the list of vulnerabilities the
OS is vulnerable to, including any exploits for these vulnerabilities. Every
Windows OS between Windows XP and Windows 10, including their Windows Server
counterparts, is supported.


The output shows either public exploits \verb+[E]+, or Metasploit modules
\verb+[M]+  as indicated by the character value.
\begin{verbatim}

# Getting help
windows-exploit-suggester -h


# Update the database
windows-exploit-suggester --update

windows-exploit-suggester --database ./<FILE>.xls --system-info ./systeminfo.txt

-e, --exploits-only = Show only vulnerabilities with known exploits
-o ~/Desktop/Result.txt
\end{verbatim}
