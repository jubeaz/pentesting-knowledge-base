\section{Conclusion: Practice steps}

Think about the skills you have gained and what interests you the most from
them. From there, we can pick out a few more modules to increase our knowledge,
machines to practice on, and Prolabs or Endgames to really put ourselves to the
test. The numbers below are a good starting example:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  2x Modules
    \item  3x Retired Machines
    \item  5x Active Machines
    \item  1x Pro Lab / Endgame
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Module}
Here is a good blueprint for tackling a module:
\begin{enumerate}
        \item Read the module
        \item Practice the exercises
        \item Complete the module
        \item Start the module exercises from scratch
        \item While solving the exercises again, take notes
        \item Create technical documentation based on the notes
        \item Create non-technical documentation based on the notes
\end{enumerate}
