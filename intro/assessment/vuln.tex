\section{Vulnerability Assessment}

{\bf Vulnerability assessments} are appropriate for all organizations and networks. A
vulnerability assessment is based on a particular security standard, and
compliance with these standards is analyzed (e.g., going through a checklist).

A vulnerability assessment can be based on various security standards. Which
standards apply to a particular network will depend on many factors. These
factors can include industry-specific and regional data security regulations,
the size and form of a company's network, which types of applications they use
or develop, and their security maturity level.

Vulnerability assessments may be performed independently or alongside other
security assessments depending on an organization's situation.
