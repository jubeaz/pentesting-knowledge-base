\section{Principles of privileges}

he levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The individual's role/function within the organisation
    \item The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system
\end{itemize}


PIM  is used to translate a user's role within an organisation into an  access role on a system. Whereas PAM is the management of the privileges  a system's access role has, amongst other things.
