\subsection{Executive Summary}

The Executive Summary of a vulnerability assessment report is intended to be readable by an executive who needs a high-level overview of the details and what is the most important items to fix immediately, depending on the severity. This section allows an executive to look at the report and prioritize remediations based on the summary.

You can also include a graphical view of the number of vulnerabilities based on the severity here

\subsection{Overview of Assessment}

The Overview of the Assessment should include any methodology leveraged during the assessment. The methodology should detail the execution of the assessment during the testing period, such as discussing the process and tools used for the project (e.g., Nessus).

\subsection{Scope and Duration}

The Scope and Duration section of the report should include everything the client authorized for the assessment, including the target scope and the testing period.

\subsection{Vulnerabilities and Recommendations}

The Vulnerabilities and Recommendations section should detail the findings
discovered during the vulnerability assessment once you've eliminated any false
positives by manually testing them. It is best to group findings that relate to
each other based on the type of issues or their severity.

Each issue should have the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  Vulnerability Name
    \item  CVE
    \item  CVSS
    \item  Description of Issue
    \item  References
    \item  Remediation Steps
    \item  Proof of Concept
    \item  Affected Systems
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Closing}

The reporting portion of any assessment is the most crucial part of the project. Always make sure you are writing your reports such that any audience can read them. When discussing technical information, always reference what you describe for the reader to understand or reproduce what you are talking about in the report. Additionally, sentences should be to the point with proper grammar as well. The strongest reports are concise and clear for a reader.
