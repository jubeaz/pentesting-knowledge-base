 Vulnerability Assessment aims to identify and categorize risks for security
 weaknesses related to assets within an environment. It is important to note
 that there is little to no manual exploitation during a vulnerability
 assessment. A vulnerability assessment also provides remediation steps to fix
 the issues.

The purpose of a Vulnerability Assessment is to understand, identify, and
categorize the risk for the more apparent issues present in an environment
without actually exploiting them to gain further access. Depending on the scope
of the assessment, some customers may ask us to validate as many
vulnerabilities as possible by performing minimally invasive exploitation to
confirm the scanner findings and rule out false positives. Other customers will
ask for a report of all findings identified by the scanner. As with any
assessment, it is essential to clarify the scope and intent of the
Vulnerability Assessment before starting. Vulnerability management is vital to
help organizations identify the weak points in their assets, understand the
risk level, and calculate and prioritize remediation efforts.

It is also important to note that organizations should always test substantial
patches before pushing them out into their environment to prevent disruptions.
