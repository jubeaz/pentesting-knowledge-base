\subsection{PASSWD NOTREQD Field (ASREPRoasting)}
It is possible to come across domain accounts with the
\href{https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/PASSWD_NOTREQD}{passwd\_notreqd} field set in
the userAccountControl attribute. If this is set, the user is not subject to
the current password policy length, meaning they could have a shorter password
or no password at all (if empty passwords are allowed in the domain). A
password may be set as blank intentionally It is worth enumerating accounts
with this flag set and testing each to see if no password is required.

\begin{verbatim}
Get-DomainUser -UACFilter PASSWD_NOTREQD | 
    Select-Object samaccountname,useraccountcontrol
