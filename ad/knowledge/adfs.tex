\section{ADFS}

\subsection{Basic Information}
{\bf Federation} is a collection of domains that have established trust. The level of trust may vary, but typically includes {\bf authentication} and almost always includes {\bf authorization}. A typical federation might include a number of organizations that have established trust for shared access to a set of resources.

in Federation, all authentication occurs in the on-prem environment and the user experiences SSO across all the trusted environments. Therefore, users can access cloud applications by using their on-prem credentials.

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is used for exchanging all the authentication and authorization information between the providers.

{\bf AD FS also supports NTLM-based authentication for on-premise users}
