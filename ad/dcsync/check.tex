To perform this attack, an account that has the rights to perform domain
replication (a user with the \emph{Replicating Directory Changes} and \emph{Replicating
Directory Changes All} permissions set) must be controled. 

To check who is able to perform this attack use a filter \\( 
\verb+| ? { ($_.ObjectAceType -match 'Replication-Get')}+ ) on ojects resturn by
either  a
\verb+Get-ObjectAcl+~\ref{tool:wlol:ad:get-ObjectACL} or
\verb+Get-DomainObjectACL+~\ref{tool:powerview:Get-DomainObjectACL} from
PowerView. 

{\bf Note:} \verb+WriteDacl+ will allow to add the right with
\verb+Add-DomainObjectACL+
