DCSync is a technique for stealing the Active Directory password database by
using the built-in  \emph{Directory Replication Service Remote Protocol}, which
is used by Domain Controllers to replicate domain data. This allows an attacker
to mimic a Domain Controller to retrieve user NTLM password hashes. 

The crux of the attack is requesting a Domain Controller to replicate passwords
via the \verb+DS-Replication-Get-Changes-All+ extended right. This is an
extended access control right within AD, which allows for the replication of
secret data.
