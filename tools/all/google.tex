\subsection*{Basic search}
Google Queries are not Case Sensitive

Google’s wildcard (\verb+*+), represents nothing more than a single word
in a search phrase. Using it at the beginning or end of a word will not
provide more hits than using the word by itself

32-Word Limit

The most commonly used Boolean operator is \verb+AND+. This operator is used to
include multiple terms in a query.

The plus symbol (\verb-+-) forces the inclusion of the word that follows it.
There should be no space following the plus symbol.

the \verb+NOT+ operator excludes a word from a search. The best way
to use this operator is to preface a search word with the minus sign \verb+–+

OR operator, represented by the pipe symbol (|) or simply the word OR in
uppercase letters, instructs Google to locate either one term or another in a
query

\begin{verbatim}
intext:(password | passcode) intext:(username | userid | user) filetype:csv.
\end{verbatim}


\subsection*{Advanced operators}
The basic syntax of an advanced operator is \verb+operator:search_term+

Rules:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There is no space between the operator, the colon, and the search term
    \item search term can be a single word or a phrase surrounded by quotes. If
        you use a phrase, just make sure there are no spaces between the
        operator, the colon, and the first quote of the phrase
    \item Boolean operators and special characters (such as OR and +) can still
        be applied to advanced operator queries, but be sure they don’t get in
        the way of the separating colon
    \item dvanced operators can be combined in a single query as long as you
        honor both the basic Google query syntax as well as the advanced
        operator syntax
    \item The ALL operators (the operators beginning with the word ALL) are
        oddballs. They are generally used once per query and cannot be mixed
        with other operators.
\end{itemize}

It’s better to go overboard and use a bunch of \verb+in+ operators in a
query rather than using \verb+allin+ operators.
