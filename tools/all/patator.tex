\subsection*{Introduction}
 Patator is a multi-purpose brute-forcer, with a modular design and a flexible
 usage.

Patator was written out of frustration from using Hydra, Medusa, Ncrack,
Metasploit modules and Nmap NSE scripts for password guessing attacks. I opted
for a different approach in order to not create yet another brute-forcing tool
and avoid repeating the same shortcomings. Patator is a multi-threaded tool
written in Python, that strives to be more reliable and flexible than his
fellow predecessors.
