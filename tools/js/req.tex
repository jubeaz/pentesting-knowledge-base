If your communication needs to involve receiving event data or message data
from a server, consider using server-sent events through the EventSource
interface. For full-duplex communication, WebSockets may be a better choice.

\subsection{WebSocket}
\href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API}{WebSocket}
API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way
interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With
this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses
without having to poll the server for a reply.


\subsection{Server-sent events}
\href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events}{server-sent
events}, it's possible for a server to send new data to a web page at any time,
by pushing messages to the web page. These incoming messages can be treated as
Events + data inside the web page.
