\section{Enumeration Methodology in Practice}

A methodology summarizes all systematic procedures in obtaining knowledge
within the bounds of a given objective. It is important to note that a
methodology is not a step-by-step guide but, as the definition implies, a
summary of systematic procedures. In our case, the enumeration methodology is
the systematic approach to explore a given target.

How the individual components are identified and information obtained in this
methodology is a dynamic and growing aspect that is constantly changing and can
therefore differ. An excellent example of this is using information-gathering
tools from web servers. There are countless different tools for this, and each
of them has a specific focus and therefore delivers individual results that
differ from other applications. The goal, however, is the same. Thus, the
collection of tools and commands is not part of the actual methodology but
rather a cheat sheet that we can refer to using the commands and tools listed
in given cases.
