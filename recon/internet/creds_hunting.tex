\href{http://dehashed.com/}{Dehashed} is an excellent tool for hunting for
cleartext credentials and password hashes in breach data. Typically we will
find many old passwords for users that do not work on externally-facing portals
that use AD auth (or internal). This is another tool that can be useful for
creating a user list for external or internal password spraying.

\begin{verbatim}
sudo python3 dehashed.py -q prey.local -p
