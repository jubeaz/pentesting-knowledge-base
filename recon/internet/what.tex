\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{|l|X|}
\hline
Data Point &	Description\\
\hline
IP Space &	Valid \gls{ASN}, netblocks in use for the public-facing infrastructure,
cloud presence and the hosting providers, DNS record entries, \ldots\\
\hline
Domain Information & 	Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who
administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied ? Are there
any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites,
VPN portals, etc.) Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM,
AV, IPS/IDS in use, \ldots)\\
\hline
Schema Format &	Can we discover email accounts, AD
usernames, and even password policies? Anything that will give information that
can be used to build a valid username list to test external-facing services for
password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, \ldots.\\
\hline
Data Disclosures &	looking fublicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx,
.xlsx, \ldots ) for any information that helps shed light on the target. For
example, any published files that contain intranet site listings, user
metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment
(credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in
the metadata of a PDF, for example. )\\
\hline
Breach Data &	Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical
information that can help  gain a foothold.\\
