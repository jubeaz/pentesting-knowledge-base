\href{https://www.arin.net/}{arin} for searching the Americas,
\href{https://www.ripe.net/}{RIPE} for
searching in Europe, \href{https://bgp.he.net/}{BGP Toolkit} 

The \href{https://bgp.he.net/}{BGP Toolkiti} is a fantastic resource for
researching from a domain or an IP address what address blocks are assigned to
an organization and what ASN they reside within.  Many large corporations will
often self-host their infrastructure, and since they have such a large
footprint, they will have their own ASN. This will typically not be the case
for smaller organizations or fledgling companies.


Smaller organizations will often host their websites and other infrastructure
in someone else's space (Cloudflare, Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure, for example).
Understanding where that infrastructure resides is extremely important. 

\begin{verbatim}
for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i \
    | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done
\end{verbatim}

\href{https://github.com/achillean/shodan-python}{shodan-python})can be used to
find devices and systems permanently connected to the Internet like Internet of
Things (IoT). It searches the Internet for open TCP/IP ports and filters the
systems according to specific terms and criteria. For example, open HTTP or
HTTPS ports and other server ports for FTP, SSH, SNMP, Telnet, RTSP, or SIP are
searched. As a result, we can find devices and systems, such as surveillance
cameras, servers, smart home systems, industrial controllers, traffic lights
and traffic controllers, and various network components.
