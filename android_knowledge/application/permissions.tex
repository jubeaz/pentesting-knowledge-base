Permissions add security to system data and
features; you can use predefined permissions, define them yourself, or declare them by
writing appropriate entries in \verb+AndroidManifest.xml+.

\subsection{Permission Types}
Permissions come in several flavors according to the desired protection level.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dangerous: This level corresponds to high-level security-sensitive
        information. The user will be asked whether they want to allow using
        that permission. Once allowed for an app, the allowance will be saved,
        and the user wonâ€™t be asked again until the app gets reinstalled or the
        permission gets explicitly revoked by using the system settings app.
    \item Signature: This level corresponds to extremely high-level
        security-sensitive information. Only apps signed with the same
        certificate as the app defining the permission can acquire it. The
        system will check whether the signatures match and then automatically
        grant the permission.
    \item Special: For a couple of use cases, the system grants access to
        certain system resources only by off-band acquisition methods. Namely,
        for permissions \verb+SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW+ and \verb+WRITE_SETTINGS+,
        declaring them in the manifest and call special intents to acquire
        them.  The intent action that  have to used for
        \verb+SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW+ is
        \verb+Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_OVERLAY_PERMISSION+, and the one for
        \verb+WRITE_SETTINGS+ is \verb+Settings.ACTION_MANAGE_WRITE_SETTINGS+.
        An app should use these two only if absolutely necessary.
    \item Privileged or System Only: These are for system image apps.
\end{itemize}


Permissions are gathered in permission groups. The idea is that once the user has
accepted a permission request from permission A of group G1, another permission inquiry
for another permission B of the same group G1 is not needed. From a user experience
perspective, permission groups show an effect only if we are talking about Dangerous type
permissions; permission groups for Normal permissions have no impact.
