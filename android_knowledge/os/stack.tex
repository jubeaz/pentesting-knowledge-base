\section{Software Stack}
Android is structured in the form of a software stack comprising applications,
an operating system, run-time environment, middleware, services and
libraries. Each layer of the stack, and the corresponding
elements within each layer, are tightly integrated and carefully tuned to
provide the optimal application development and execution environment for
mobile devices.
