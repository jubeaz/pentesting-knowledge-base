The Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM) was specifically designed for the Android
platform and is unique to it. The main reason for its existence is that it was
designed to run on hardware with processing and memory constraints and is much
lighter than the normal Java Virtual Machine. It was designed in a way that
allows many Dalvik VMs to be run at the same time in a memory-efficient manner.
The code that runs on it is written and compiled to Java classes and then
converted into a single \verb+DEX+ file using the dx SDK utility.
