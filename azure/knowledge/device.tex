\subsection{What is a device}

A device (aka \href{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/overview}{device identity} is one of the object types in Azure AD.

{\bf Devices are identified by certificates} created during the registration process.

\href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/device?view=graph-rest-1.0}{Microsoft Graph REST API}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb+objectId+: Entra ID id of the object

    \item \verb+dirSyncEnabled+: indicates whether the device is synchronised from the on-prem AD or not. True for Hybrid Joined devices.
    \item \verb+isManaged+: Indicates whether the device is managed or not. Always True for Hybrid Joined devices. For Registered and Joined devices, the attribute needs to be set by device management application
    \item \verb+idCompliant+: Indicates whether the device is compliant or not. Attribute needs to be set by device management application
    \item \verb+reserved1+: The userCertificate attribute of the device from the on-prem AD object for Hybrid Joined devices. Public key with a subject name that equals to \verb+objectGuid+ of the on-prem AD device object.

\subsection{Registeration flow}
\href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/device-registration-how-it-works}{How it works: Device registration}


No matter what registration type, the computer will generate  two sets of cryptographic key pairs (see \href{https://aadinternals.com/post/prt}{this blog for details}):
\begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf Device key} (\verb+dkpub/dkpriv+): used to identify the device
    \item {\bf Transport key} (\verb+tkpub/tkpriv+): used to decrypt the {\bf session key} when requesting the {\bf PRT}
\end{itemize}

The {\bf session key} is used as the Proof-of-Possession (POP) key, and also protected by TPM.

The private keys are bound to the device's TPM if the device has a valid and functioning TPM, while the public keys are sent to Microsoft Entra ID during the device registration process. These keys are used to validate the device state during PRT requests.

{\em The application creates TPM bound (preferred) RSA 2048 bit key-pair known as the device key (dkpub/dkpriv). The application creates a certificate request using dkpub and the public key and signs the certificate request with using dkpriv. Next, the application derives second key pair from the TPM's storage root key. This key is the transport key (tkpub/tkpriv).}


\subsection{Register}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The registration software (depends on the device) generate {\bf Device key} and {\bf Transport key}
    \item A certificate signing request for \verb+CN=7E980AD9-B86D-4306-9425-9AC066FB014A+ (dkpub) is generated with dkpriv
    \item Request access token for Azure AD Join for AppID \verb+1b730954-1685-4b74-9bfd-dac224a7b894 (Azure Active Directory PowerShell) with audience \verb+01cb2876-7ebd-4aa4-9cc9-d28bd4d359a9+ (Device Registration Service)
    \item device registration request to Azure DRS that includes the access token at \verb+https://enterpriseregistration.windows.net/EnrollmentServer/device/?api-version=1.0”+
    \item 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Hybrid join (Managed)}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find service connection point stored in the configuration partition in Active Directory \verb+LDAP://CN=62a0ff2e-97b9-4513-943f-0d221bd30080,CN=Device Registration Configuration,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=...+. The value returned in the keywords attribute determines if device registration is directed to {\bf Azure Device Registration Service (DRS)} or the {\bf enterprise device registration service} hosted on-premises.
    \item Generate self-signed Machine certificate and write it to \verb+userCertificate+ attribute on the computer object in Active Directory
    \item Wait for Entra Connect to sync. by sending \verb+userCertificate+, object \verb+GUID+, and computer \verb+SID+ to Azure DRS. 
    \item Azure DRS uses the attribute information to create a device object in Microsoft Entra ID.
    \item The Automatic Device Join task triggers (each user sign-in or every hour) to authenticate the computer with the private key o the certificate. The computer receive an access token 
    \item Generate {\bf Device key} and {\bf Transport key}.
    \item The task sends a device registration request to Azure DRS that includes the access token, certificate request, tkpub, and attestation data. a part of the enrollment request is signed  with the private key of the computer’s machine certificate.
    \item Azure DRS 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item validates the access token
            \item create a device ID
            \item creates a certificate based on the included certificate request
            \item updates the device object in Microsoft Entra ID (public key of the certificate is added to \verb+reserved1+ attribute)
            \item return device ID and the device certificate to the client
        \end{itemize}
    \item the device:
        \begin{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hybrid join (Federated)}

pretty much the same as managed but the request to obtain the access token to registration is made with a SAML token that is obtained by a request to AD FS.

The access token obtained is also different:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \verb+account type+: always \verb+DJ+
    \item \verb+on_prem_id+: on-prem AD object id 
    \item \verb+primary_sid+: SID of the device 
    \item \verb+idp+ and \verb+unique_name+: the issuer uri of the AD FS (domain part of the uri is the domain of the device, not FQDN of the AD FS service)
\end{itemize}
