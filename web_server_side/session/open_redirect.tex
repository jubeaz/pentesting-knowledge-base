An Open Redirect vulnerability occurs when an attacker can redirect a victim to
an attacker-controlled site by abusing a legitimate application's redirection
functionality. In such cases, all the attacker has to do is specify a website
under their control in a redirection URL of a legitimate website and pass this
URL to the victim. As you can imagine, this is possible when the legitimate
application's redirection functionality does not perform any kind of validation
regarding the websites to which the redirection points. From an attacker's
perspective, an open redirect vulnerability can prove extremely useful during
the initial access phase since it can lead victims to attacker-controlled web
pages through a page that they trust.


\begin{verbatim}
$red = $_GET['url'];

\end{verbatim}

Make sure you check for the following URL parameters when bug hunting, you'll
often see them in login pages. Example: \verb+/login.php?redirect=dashboard+
