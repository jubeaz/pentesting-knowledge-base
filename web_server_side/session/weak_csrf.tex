\section{Weak CSRF token}

When assessing how robust a CSRF token generation mechanism is, make sure you
spend a small amount of time trying to come up with the CSRF token generation
mechanism. It can be as easy as \verb+md5(username)+, \verb+sha1(username)+, 
\verb-md5(current date + username)- etc. Please note that you should not spend
much time on this, but it is worth a shot.
