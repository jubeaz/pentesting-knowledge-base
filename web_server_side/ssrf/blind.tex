\section{Blind SSRF}
blind SSRF vulnerabilities can be detected via out-of-band techniques, making
the server issue a request to an external service under control. To detect if a
backend service is processing requests, online tools like
\href{http://pingb.in}{http://pingb.in}can be used. 

Blind SSRF vulnerabilities could exist in PDF Document generators and HTTP
Headers, among other locations.
