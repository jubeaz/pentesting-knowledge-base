A server-side template injection occurs when an attacker is able to use native
template syntax to inject a malicious payload into a template, which is then
executed server-side.a

Template engines are designed to generate web pages by combining fixed
templates with volatile data. Server-side template injection attacks can occur
when user input is concatenated directly into a template, rather than passed in
as data. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary template directives in order
to manipulate the template engine, often enabling them to take complete control
of the server.a

An example of vulnerable code see the following one:
\begin{verbatim}
output = $twig->render("Dear " . $_GET['name']);
\end{verbatim}

In the previous example part of the template itself is being dynamically
generated using the GET parameter name. As template syntax is evaluated
server-side, this potentially allows an attacker to place a server-side
template injection payload inside the name parameter as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
http://vulnerable-website.com/?name={{bad-stuff-here}}
\end{verbatim}
