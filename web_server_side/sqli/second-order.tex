\section{Second order SQL injection}

A second order sqli arise when the malicious code injected into an application
by the attacker which does not get immediately executed in the application.


The user-provided data becomes a threat when it is utilized by the application
or any other application wherein the injected code provided by the attacker
gets activated resulting in successful exploitation.

Usually this arise when the malicious input is njected into persistent storage
(such as a table row) which is deemed as a trusted source for other activities.

Automated web-application assessment tools are not adequate to identify these
vulnerabilities. An automated tool is not smart enough to identify the change
in application behavior in any of the subsequent responses caused by the
malicious injection in one of the previous queries.

This kind of vulnerability happens because a good programmer maybe will patch
his code to prevent SQL injections in forms where the user can input something
BUT he will not do the same thing where a user doesnâ€™t have any sort of
interaction with the application database.
