\subsection{Format}
Java, use binary serialization formats. iSerialized Java objects always begin
with the same bytes, which are encoded as \verb+ac ed+ in hexadecimal and
\verb+rO0+ in Base64.

Any class that implements the interface \verb+java.io.Serializable+ can be
serialized and deserialized. The \verb+readObject()+ method is used to read and
deserialize data from an \verb+InputStream+.
