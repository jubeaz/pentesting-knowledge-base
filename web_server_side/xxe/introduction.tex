XML External Entity (XXE) Injection vulnerabilities occur when XML data is
taken from a user-controlled input without properly sanitizing or safely
parsing it, which may allow us to use XML features to perform malicious
actions. XXE vulnerabilities can cause considerable damage to a web application
and its back-end server, from disclosing sensitive files to shutting the
back-end server down, which is why it is considered one of the Top 10 Web
Security Risks by OWASP.
