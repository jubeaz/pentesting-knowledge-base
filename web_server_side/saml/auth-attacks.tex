\section{Authentication vulnerabilities}

\subsection{Access to the private key}
simply resign the message with the private key

\subsection{Certificate Faking}

In some cases, we may be able to perform the same attack without even having
the private key if the SAML was not securely configured. Once we capture the
request, we can choose Send certificate to SAML Raider Certificates, then go to
the extension and select Save and Self-sign, and the self-signature may also
work. In the next section, we will see a similar attack.


\subsection{No Signature Verification}
temper and send the message without action on signatures

\subsection{Signature Stripping Attack}
tamper and empty  both \verb+SignatureValue+

\begin{verbatim}
<ds:SignatureValue></ds:SignatureValue>
\end{verbatim}
