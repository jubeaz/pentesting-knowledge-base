\section{Basic exploitation}
The most basic type of file upload vulnerability occurs when the web
application does not have any form of validation filters on the uploaded files,
allowing the upload of any file type by default.

first step would be to identify what language runs the web application. 

in certain web frameworks and web languages, {\bf Web Routes} are used to map URLs
 to web pages, in which case the web page extension may not be shown.
 Furthermore, file upload exploitation would also be different, as the uploaded
 files may not be directly routable or accessible.

 There exists several methode:
\begin{itemize}
     \item fuzzing for the extension of page (like index)
     \item using \href{https://www.wappalyzer.com/}{wappalyzer} 
\end{itemize}

To validate vulnerability a simple script like ``Hello world'' can be uploaded.
