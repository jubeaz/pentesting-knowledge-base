\section{Introduction}
IDOR is among the most common web vulnerabilities and can lead to accessing
data that should not be accessible by attackers. What makes this attack very
common is essentially the lack of a solid access control system on the
back-end. As web applications store users' files and information, they may use
sequential numbers or user IDs to identify each item. Suppose the web
application lacks a robust access control mechanism and exposes direct
references to files and resources (\verb+download.php?file_id=123+). In that
case, it is access other users' files and information by simply guessing or
calculating their file IDs.
