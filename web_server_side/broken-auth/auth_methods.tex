\subsection{HTTP based authentication}

When using HTTP-based authentication, the Authorization header holds the authentication data and should be present in every request for the user to be authenticated.
\begin{verbatim}
GET /basic_auth.php HTTP/1.1
Host: brokenauth.hackthebox.eu
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46czNjdXIzcDQ1NQ==
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Form-Based authentication}

The most common authentication method for web applications is Form-Based
Authentication (FBA). The application presents an HTML form where the user
inputs their username and password, and then access is granted after comparing
the received data against a backend. After a successful login attempt, the
application server creates a session tied to a unique key (usually stored in a
cookie). This unique key is passed between the client and the web application
on every subsequent communication for the session to be maintained.

\subsection{Other forms of authentication}

Modern applications could use third parties to authenticate users, such as

Also, APIs usually require a specific authentication form, often based on a
multi-step approach.
