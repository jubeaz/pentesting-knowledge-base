\section{Recompiling the APK}
Apks have to be signed by the developer. But you can be your own developer. But you still have
to sign them. So after you have decompile the apk, you can recompile it as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
apktool b <path-to-decompiled> -o unsigned.apk
# OR
apktool b . #In the folder generated when you decompiled the application
\end{verbatim}
