\subsection{slack API}
The Slack API is how all Slack clients, including the official desktop app and third-party bots, read and write data that constitutes the Slack user experience. All clients much provide authorisation to access the API.

As of July 2021, individual user access to the Slack API (as opposed to bot access) is granted by providing a personal token (beginning with xoxc-) and a cookie called d. Each Slack Workspace has its own personal token, but the cookie is the same for all.

If you use the Slack desktop app, these details will be stored on your local machine. This script extracts them from the app's local store so you can use them for purposes not provided for by the app itself.

Your personal tokens are extracted by querying the Slack app's HTML Web Storage database. The token for each Workspace is stored in a dictionary in the localStorage object, in a LevelDB database. The useful fields extracted from the dictionary, other than the token itself, are the human readable Workspace name, and the Workspace URL.

The cookie is extracted from the Slack app's cookie store. The cookie of interest is stored encrypted, so a modified version of pycookiecheat is used to decrypt the contents. The decryption process will prompt you for your user password, which is used only to pull out the cookie store encryption secret from your keychain.
