\section{Introduction}

\href{https://tomcat.apache.org/}{Apache Tomcat} is an open-source web server
that hosts applications written in Java. Tomcat was initially designed to run
Java Servlets and Java Server Pages (JSP) scripts. However, its popularity
increased in Java-based frameworks and is now widely used by frameworks such as
Spring and tools such as Gradle.
