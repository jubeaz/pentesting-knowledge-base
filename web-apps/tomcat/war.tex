\section{Tomcat Manager - WAR File Upload}

Many Tomcat installations provide a GUI interface to manage the application.
This interface is available at \verb+/manager/html+ by default, which only
users assigned the \verb+manager-gui+ role are allowed to access.

Craft a \verb+war+ (Web Application Archive) reverse shell
(\verb+java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp+) payload with msfvenom~\ref{tool:msfvenom} 


The \verb+multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload+ Metasploit module can be used to
automate the process.
