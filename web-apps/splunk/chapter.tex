\chapter{splunk}

Splunk is a log analytics tool used to gather, analyze and visualize data.
Though not originally intended to be a SIEM tool, Splunk is often used for
security monitoring and business analytics. Splunk deployments are often used
to house sensitive data and could provide a wealth of information for an
attacker if compromised. Historically, Spunk has not suffered from many known
vulnerabilities aside from an information disclosure vulnerability
(CVE-2018-11409) and an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability in
very old versions (CVE-2011-4642).
