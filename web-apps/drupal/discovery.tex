Another way to identify Drupal CMS is through
\href{https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/node/about-nodes}{nodes}. Drupal indexes its content
using nodes. A node can hold anything such as a blog post, poll, article, etc.
The page URIs are usually of the form \verb+/node/<nodeid>+.

Drupal supports three types of users by default:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Administrator: This user has complete control over the Drupal website.
    \item Authenticated User: These users can log in to the website and perform operations such as adding and editing articles based on their permissions.
    \item Anonymous: All website visitors are designated as anonymous. By default, these users are only allowed to read posts.
\end{itemize}
