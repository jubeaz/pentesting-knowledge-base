\section{Authenticated Remote Code Execution}
GitLab Community Edition version 13.10.2 and lower suffered from an
authenticated remote code execution
\href{https://hackerone.com/reports/1154542}{vulnerability} due to an issue
with ExifTool handling metadata in uploaded image files. This issue was fixed
by GitLab rather quickly, but some companies are still likely using a
vulnerable version. Use this
