\section{Enumeration}

he first thing we should try is browsing to \verb+/explore+ and see if there
are any public projects that may contain something interesting.


On isome instance of GitLab it is possible to enumerate emails. try to register
with an email that has already been taken, the error will show:
\verb+1 error prohibited this user from being saved: Email has already been taken+.
